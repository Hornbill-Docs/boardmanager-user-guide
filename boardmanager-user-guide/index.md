# Overview 
Board Manager is an incredibly easy and flexible way to manage and track many different types of work within your business. You can define multiple boards that offer a visual presentation of projects, documents, activities, and much much more. Board Manager integrates with many of the other great Hornbill apps giving you defined views and tracking of different types of work that is undertaken by either a small team or up to an entire organization.
